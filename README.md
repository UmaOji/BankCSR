## Introduction
### Brief Overview of the Project
This project involves analyzing a large dataset containing corporate social responsibility (CSR) spending data from several leading Nigerian banks. The dataset includes information on CSR activities, including total amounts spent across different months and regions, the number of beneficiaries impacted, and distinctions based on quarterly periods. The analysis focuses on identifying spending patterns, regional distributions of beneficiaries, and seasonal variations in CSR activities to provide valuable insights into the social outreach efforts of these financial institutions.

### Purpose of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to uncover key insights into the CSR efforts of Nigerian banks by exploring:
- **Spending Patterns**: How CSR expenditures vary across different months, quarters, and regions.
- **Beneficiary Impact**: Analyzing the number of beneficiaries in different regions and understanding the correlation between spending and beneficiaries.
- **Seasonal and Regional Trends**: Detecting peaks in spending during key periods such as holidays and summer months, and identifying which regions receive more CSR efforts.
This analysis aims to help stakeholders understand the social outreach strategies of banks and guide future CSR initiatives to achieve maximum social impact.

### Data Sources
The dataset used for this analysis is *synthetic* but modeled to reflect realistic CSR spending patterns for 10 major Nigerian banks:
- Zenith Bank
- Guaranty Trust Bank (GT Bank)
- First Bank of Nigeria
- Ecobank Nigeria
- Wema Bank
- Access Bank
- United Bank of Nigeria
- Diamond Bank
- Union Bank of Nigeria
- Fidelity Bank

The dataset includes 50,000 records with the following columns:
- **Bank**: The bank responsible for the CSR expenditure.
- **Month**: The month when the CSR activities occurred (e.g., Jan, Feb, etc.).
- **Quarter**: The quarter of the year (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4).
- **Total_Amount_Spent**: The total amount spent on CSR activities during that period.
- **Beneficiaries**: The number of individuals benefiting from the CSR activities.
- **Region**: The region where the CSR activity took place, categorized into North Central (NC), North East (NE), North West (NW), South West (SW), South East (SE), and South South (SS).
