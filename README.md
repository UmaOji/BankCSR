## Introduction
#### Brief Overview of the Project
This project involves analyzing a large dataset containing corporate social responsibility (CSR) spending data from several leading Nigerian banks. The dataset includes information on CSR activities, including total amounts spent across different months and regions, the number of beneficiaries impacted, and distinctions based on quarterly periods. The analysis focuses on identifying spending patterns, regional distributions of beneficiaries, and seasonal variations in CSR activities to provide valuable insights into the social outreach efforts of these financial institutions.

#### Purpose of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to uncover key insights into the CSR efforts of Nigerian banks by exploring:
- **Spending Patterns**: How CSR expenditures vary across different months, quarters, and regions.
- **Beneficiary Impact**: Analyzing the number of beneficiaries in different regions and understanding the correlation between spending and beneficiaries.
- **Seasonal and Regional Trends**: Detecting peaks in spending during key periods such as holidays and summer months, and identifying which regions receive more CSR efforts.
This analysis aims to help stakeholders understand the social outreach strategies of banks and guide future CSR initiatives to achieve maximum social impact.

#### Data Sources
The dataset used for this analysis is *synthetic* but modeled to reflect realistic CSR spending patterns for 10 major Nigerian banks:
- Zenith Bank
- Guaranty Trust Bank (GT Bank)
- First Bank of Nigeria
- Ecobank Nigeria
- Wema Bank
- Access Bank
- United Bank of Nigeria
- Diamond Bank
- Union Bank of Nigeria
- Fidelity Bank

The dataset includes 50,000 records with the following columns:
- **Bank**: The bank responsible for the CSR expenditure.
- **Month**: The month when the CSR activities occurred.
- **Quarter**: The quarter of the year (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4).
- **Total_Amount_Spent**: The total amount spent on CSR activities during that period.
- **Beneficiaries**: The number of individuals benefiting from the CSR activities.
- **Region**: The region where the CSR activity took place, categorized into North Central (NC), North East (NE), North West (NW), South West (SW), South East (SE), and South South (SS).
---
## Data Cleaning and Preparation
#### 1. Data Loading
- The CSR dataset is first loaded into Excel using the **Import from Text/CSV** option in the **Data** tab. This process imports the raw dataset for analysis.

---

#### 2. Handling Missing Values
**Step 1**: Identify missing values
- To identify missing values in Excel, use conditional formatting:
  - Select the entire dataset.
  - Navigate to the **Home** tab -> **Conditional Formatting** -> **New Rule**.
  - Choose **Format only cells that contain**, and select **Blanks**.
  - Apply a format (e.g., a light red fill) to highlight missing values.

**Step 2**: Handle missing values
- For columns like `Total_Amount_Spent` or `Beneficiaries`, missing values can be imputed using either the average or median.
  - Formula to calculate the average:
    ```excel
    =IF(ISBLANK(C2), AVERAGE(C:C), C2)
    ```
  - This formula replaces missing values in column C (Total Amount Spent) with the average of the column.
  - Similarly, apply this to other numerical columns like `Beneficiaries`.

---

#### 3. Changing Month Abbreviations (e.g., Jan, Feb, Sep) to Full Month Names

**Step 1**: Create a lookup table
- Create a table with abbreviated months and full month names in two columns (e.g., `E1:F12`):
  - Cell `E1`: `Jan`, Cell `F1`: `January`
  - Cell `E2`: `Feb`, Cell `F2`: `February`
  - Continue for all months.

**Step 2**: Use the `VLOOKUP` function to replace abbreviations
- Formula to convert abbreviated months to full names:
  ```excel
  =VLOOKUP(B2, $E$1:$F$12, 2, FALSE)
  ```
  This formula looks up the abbreviated month in column `B` (e.g., "Jan") and returns the full month name from the lookup table.

**Step 3**: Place the full month names in a new column next to the existing month column.

---

#### 4. Splitting the `Region` Column into Two Separate Columns

**Step 1**: Separate `South` and `(SS)` into two columns
- The `Region` column contains values like `South (SS)`. To split this into two columns:
  - Formula to extract the first part (`South`):
    ```excel
    =LEFT(F2, FIND("(", F2)-2)
    ```
**Step 2**: Changing "South" to "South South"
- Some values may be "South," which we want to change to "South South."
  - Formula to change `South` to `South South`
    ```excel
    =IF(H2="South", "South South", H2)
    ```

---

#### Other Useful Data Cleaning Processes

- **Removing duplicates**: To ensure no duplicate records, select the dataset and go to **Data** -> **Remove Duplicates**.
- **Standardizing case**: Ensure consistent capitalization in the `Bank` and `Region` columns by using:
  ```excel
  =PROPER(A2)
  ```
  This formula converts text to title case (capitalizing the first letter of each word).
- **Handling inconsistent entries**: For any inconsistencies in categorical data (e.g., different spellings of the same bank), use the `Find and Replace` feature (`Ctrl + H`) to standardize the names.

## Analysis of Beneficiaries
#### Number of Beneficiaries
The number of beneficiaries impacted by CSR initiatives is a key indicator of the reach and effectiveness of the programs implemented by the banks. Across the dataset, the total number of beneficiaries is **32,063,066**, reflecting the wide range of individuals and communities that have been positively affected by these efforts. Notably, CSR spending tends to correlate with the number of beneficiaries, with higher spending areas, such as healthcare and education, reaching a greater portion of the population.

#### Impact of CSR Initiatives on Beneficiaries
While the dataset is synthetic and does not directly provide detailed information on the specific impacts of CSR initiatives, based on the spending patterns and areas of focus, it can be reasonably perceived that:

- **Healthcare**: CSR spending in healthcare likely contributes to improved access to medical services, particularly in underserved regions, where increased healthcare funding may result in better health outcomes and reduced treatment costs.
- **Education**: Investments in education could be providing scholarships, infrastructure improvements, and learning resources, particularly benefiting students in rural or underserved areas. This would align with the significant spending trends in education.
- **Community Development**: Despite being the lowest in terms of CSR spending, community development initiatives may still provide some benefits, such as access to clean water or improved infrastructure, although at a smaller scale compared to healthcare and education efforts. The lower investment in this area suggests it may not be a primary focus for most banks.

Though the dataset does not explicitly provide outcome data, these insights are inferred from the nature of the CSR areas and their relative spending levels.

## Conclusion
#### Key Findings
The analysis of the synthetic Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) dataset reveals several important trends:

- **Healthcare and Education as Priorities**: A large portion of CSR spending is concentrated in healthcare and education, suggesting that banks are prioritizing these areas as part of their social impact strategies.
- **Regional Focus**: The South-South (SS) and South-West (SW) regions received the most attention in terms of beneficiaries, while other regions, such as the North-East (NE) and North-West (NW), saw comparatively fewer CSR efforts.
- **Low Focus on Community Development**: Community development initiatives received the lowest total funding among all CSR areas, indicating that it is not a primary focus for the majority of banks in this dataset.

#### Limitations of the Analysis
Several limitations of this analysis should be noted:

- **Synthetic Data**: Since the dataset is synthetic, the results are purely illustrative and do not reflect real-world data. This limits the applicability of the analysis to actual CSR trends and impacts.
- **Absence of Demographic Data**: There was no available data on age, gender, or specific location in the relevant fields of the dataset. This limitation prevented any detailed analysis on the **Beneficiary Demographics**, such as the age or gender distribution of those impacted by CSR initiatives.
- **Lack of Outcome Data**: The dataset does not include direct measures of the effectiveness or outcomes of CSR spending, such as improved health or educational attainment. The impact assessments are inferred based on spending patterns rather than real beneficiary outcomes.
- **Granularity of Categories**: The CSR areas are broad, which limits the depth of analysis. For example, breaking down healthcare into subcategories like primary care, vaccination programs, or hospital infrastructure could provide more detailed insights.

#### Recommendations for Future Research
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are suggested for future research:

- **Real-World Data Collection**: To enhance the value of the analysis, future research should involve actual CSR data from financial institutions, including detailed outcomes and impact assessments.
- **More Granular Data**: A more granular breakdown of CSR spending categories would allow for deeper insights into which specific initiatives within education, healthcare, or community development are most effective.
- **Longitudinal Analysis**: Incorporating a time-series analysis over several years could help track shifts in CSR priorities and their long-term effects on communities and beneficiaries.
- **Beneficiary Feedback**: Collecting data directly from beneficiaries about how CSR initiatives have impacted their lives would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the social impact.
- **Inclusion of Demographic Data**: Future datasets should include age, gender, and location information to allow for a more detailed demographic analysis of the beneficiaries and a better understanding of the equity and inclusiveness of CSR programs.
